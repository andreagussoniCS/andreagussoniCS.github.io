                                <h1 style="color: white;">Week 1 and 2</h1>
				<p>
					In the first two weeks we created this portfolio, these are an early introduction to computer science world, starting with readings
					on what a computer science professional is and what are his challenges and his responsibilities. In the second week we moved on
					analysing the technical evolution of computers and computing technologies and how incredibly well a computer can handle data.
					I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge on a topic we often give for granted which is computer architecture.
				</p>
				<h1 style="color: white;">Week 3 and 4</h1>
				<p>
				The third week is about emerging trends in the computer science field, from cloud computing to artificial intelligence this is
				a really engaging week. We explored google AI tools and i found out that AI powered google translator can identify dialect and
				slang translation from my native language to english which is quite impressive. Week 4 is about networks and infrastructures, LAN, 4G
				and the most recent 5G. We investigated in topics that were familiar to like http protocols and html language, a good knowledge refresh.
				</p>
				<h1 style="color: white;">Week 5 and 6</h1>
				<p>
				These two weeks we explored softwares and operating systems. Week 5 encouraged us to think about an application and i chose one that
				most of us use everyday, VScode. I think that this is a tremendously well done code editor with an extensions system that is extremely 
				inclusive and useful. Integration with lots of external sources like docker and built in tools are really well done. Not limiting the creation 
				of extensions to microsoft only gives so much value to the application. Plus it's free.
				Try VScode inside your browser and integrated with your GitHub repo it works incredibly well (press "." key on your keyboard when on your repo page)
				Week 6 focuses more on OS and pushed us to think about
				a particular OS of our choice. The hated and loved Windows. Windows is big, full of customization, compatible with most of anything that comes 
				to mind, but has never been revisited. Under all the new features and looks there are some of the old parts of code that are not touched since
				years. Still an incredible platform.
				</p>
				<h1 style="color: white">Week 7 and 8</h1>
				<p>
				Week 7 and 8 are about basic data structures, especially in Python. We are encouraged to think about stacks and queues, two linear data structures,
				stacks follow the LIFO order, last in first out, like a pile of books where you pick or add a book from the top. While queues are linear and FIFO,
				first first out. You can only insert from the rear which is the top of the pile of books and you can only delete elements from the front which is 
				the bottom of the pile of books. In unit 8 we delivered our first design of a coding assignment, i chose a phone book written in python. A good occasion to think about 
				data structures and custom loops and functions.
				</p>
				<h1 style="color: white;">From week 9 to 11</h1>
				<p>
					Week nine was about exploring how to solve problems with Python. Learning algorithms and complexity
					i had the opportunity to reflect and see how many possibilities coding has and how many problems can solve.
					In week 10 we delivered the code for the assignment started in week 8 and started working on 
					MySQL databases and learning what databases are, how they are used and designed.
					Week 11 continued the MySQL with advanced operations and the submission of a MySQL assignment performing operations
					on a company database.
				</p>
				<h1 style="color:white">Week 12</h1>
				<p>
					Week 12 is the last week of the first module and also the deadline for the submission of the end of modul
					assignment. This was an essay about a new computer science trend using a case study. I wrote about blockchain in financial market 
					and Visa (payment provider) case. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358747417_VISA_a_vis_with_blockchain_technology">Available here.</a>
