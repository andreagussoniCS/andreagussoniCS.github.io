                                    First module started with the introduction to Project management principles and history, explaining the differences between traditional project management and software engineering project management.
                                    Project management has been a practiced discipline for many years but in my opinion it got a fast development in the software era.
                                    As usual we start the module with a peer collaborative discussion about the fail history of big projects and the reasons behing, I'll leave below my contribution.
                                </p>
                                <p style="border:1px solid white; padding: 10px;">
                                    Based on the analysis presented by Lehtinen et al. (2014), the three most common reasons for project failure are communication issues, inadequate project management practices, and unclear requirements. 

Communication issues can arise from a lack of communication among project stakeholders or from miscommunication and misunderstandings. Inadequate project management practices can lead to delays, cost overruns, and quality problems, while unclear requirements can result in software that does not meet user needs or expectations.

One example of a software project failure caused by communication issues is the FBI's Virtual Case File (VCF) project. The project was aimed at developing a modern case management system for the FBI, but it was eventually canceled after spending over $100 million due to communication breakdowns between project stakeholders, including the FBI and its contractor. The lack of clear communication and alignment of expectations led to delays, cost overruns, and ultimately the project's failure.

Another example of a software project failure caused by inadequate project management practices is the Denver International Airport baggage handling system project. The project was aimed at developing a fully automated baggage handling system for the airport, but it suffered from a series of project management issues, including scope creep, insufficient testing, and lack of stakeholder involvement. These problems led to a delay of over a year and cost overruns of over $1 billion, ultimately resulting in the system's failure to meet its objectives (Callem Consulting, 2004).
