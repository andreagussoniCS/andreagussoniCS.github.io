                                <p>The first unit of the module opens up with a reasoning quiz focused on understanding the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning. Topics like this seem obvious and you usually don't think much about them but they are
                                    more important that may seem, reflecting on the obvious things is almost always an extraordinary excercise to develop critical thinking.
                                    The week progresses with a discussion about some case studies invented by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/case-studies">ACM</a>. The goal here is to reflect and contribute about how important are ethics in the world of Computer science.
                                    I'll leave here my first post for reference and express my thoughts after.</p>

The case study from ACM describes a situation at Q Industries, an international defence contractor specializing in autonomous vehicles. The company has been experimenting with automated active responses, including facial recognition and non-lethal incapacitation measures, but has been approached by multiple governments to expand to lethal responses (ACM, 2017).

Multiple Q industries engineers resigned after the company's leadership accepted the government's proposals, fearing and not supporting the effects of these assignments, which violated points 1.2 and 2.7 of the ACM ethics code, on ethical conduct. The BCS Code of Conduct (British Computer Society, 2018) also prioritizes public good and ethical behaviour, encouraging computing professionals to consider the potential impact of their work on society.

The situation raises multiple concerns about the violation of the privacy of people involved, the right of protestors (V. Aston, 2017) to manifest and the problematic topic of giving lethal weapons to automated systems, a computer can never be held accountable (IBM, 1970).

                                    The cases were pretty interesting but i chose this one because it was perfect to highlight how much of an impact can computer science have. Often we underestimate the damage we can do, thinking that it's just a software and it can't physically harm anyone.
                                    This example evidences the opposite. It is also important to mention that harm is not only physical but a incredible amount of damage can be done without injuring anyone.
                                    <br>
                                    There is a reflective excercise in this unit on the work of <strong>Stahl et al (2016) and Bott (2018) Chapter 1</strong>. The documents were about ethics and laws. My opinion is that while laws are obviously a fundamental part
                                    of any work that any professional should know about, ethics are more personal and subject to variations. CS professional are certainly required to follow their relevant organizations' laws. When it comes to non-regulated ethics it is more complicated.
                                    It is useful to refer to some of the ethics codes that are available and they are an invaluable source for reflection. There can be cases, however, where an individual needs to make difficult decisions that aren't covered in those codes or are too complex to be 
                                    categorized. It is up to the moral rectitude of the person to decide what's right and what's not. I personally believe that the people wotking in such a modern field that requires an open and agile mind are able to make the right decision in scenarios of uncertainty. 
									<br>
									Lastly there was a quiz about inductive vs deductive reasoning. We can think of deductive reasoning just like a pyramid where the tip and starting point then you go through the middle which is the hypothesis and the base is the theory extracted. For the inductive reasoning
									you invert the pyramid so now you start with a theory, you continue through observation and hypothesis to arrive at a conclusion.
                                </p>
								<h1 style="color: white;">Unit 2</h1>
								<p>
									In unit 2 we started choosing the topic for the literature review from a fairly complete list of arguments. I immediately found the sentiment analysis topic fascinating. My plan was to use the sentiment analysis topic for the literature review and then, maybe with a twist, for the research proposal. 
									I sent an eamil to the tutor to ask what could be better to do and it was very helpful.
									Apart from this the main formative activity of unit 2 was to answer to my colleagues' posts in the discussion started in Unit 1. I'll leave the <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=135767#p190476">LINK</a> to my post with all the responses
									since it would be verbose to include it here. And here are my responses to <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=135690#p192237">Kate's</a> post and <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=135597#p194225">Jonathan's</a> post.
								</p>
								<h1 style="color:white">Unit 3</h1>
								<p>
									This week was about the different type of research methods. In particular the e-portfolio activity was to think about the most suitable approach for my chosen topic. While the literature review is a qualitative and critic focused research independently of the topic, as suggested by our tutor, 
									The research proposal is different. Since my topic is about machine learning and sentiment analysis the correct approach for this topic would be quantitative and experimental. As read in many researches in the field, the greatest part of this type of research is testing the models created
									and gather data to compare performances. Therefore the main data collecting method would be experiments and observations.
								</p>
								<p >
									This week was also the conclusion of the collaborative discussion where we had to make a summary post about our initial post and subsequent responses. I really enjoyed the discussion, especially reading different points of view that I couldn't think of myself.
									Here is my post:
								</p>
								<p style="border:1px solid white; padding: 10px;">
									
First of all, thanks for the responses to my post.

As a conclusion to this thread, I'm using as a starting point Kate's response. Are the remaining engineers in wrong for respecting the confidentiality agreement and not risking their careers and maybe their economic/social stability? This is one of the most complex topics, ethics. The term has been defined in different ways throughout history. Ethics matter is subjective both in its definition and interpretation. It is not a measurable metric and what is ethical to one could not be to another. This is why codes of conduct exist and they try to give an interpretation of what is better for the majority of a community, the computing community in this case (ACM, BCS 2017, 2018).

Ethics in modern society can be viewed as a collection of standards and moral values that humans usually agree on, for example, the repudiation of murder, stealing or fraud (Velazquez et al, 2010).

According to this the engineers that resigned and denounced the case are in this case considered ethical, but again, this would be my interpretation.

								</p>
								<h1 style="color: white;">Unit 4 and 5</h1>
								<p>
									There was an opportunity to present the outline for the literature review to recieve formative feedback. This was a great opportunity and the first module that had it. Unfortunately I was behind schedule and provided a very short and not meaningful outline. The tutor was anyway kind enough to answer with suggestions to my submission and email.
									This is actually already one of the most challenging modules for me and keeping up is not always easy. You can find the artifact in this GitHub <a href="https://github.com/andreagussoniCS/research-methods-module">repo</a>.
									
								</p>
								<p>
									Then in Unit 5 the focus was on survey methods and population sampling. The e-portfolio specific activity for this unit was a reflective piece about the inappropriate use of surveys. Here is my thoughts:

								</p>
								<p style="border:1px solid white; padding: 10px;">
									The case of Cambridge analytica is a complex and interesting one. To briefly summarize, the data collected by Aleksandr Kogan in his application (his application had access to Facebook users data through Facebok login, and due to
									 a fault in Facebook's policy the login gave access also to the user's friends data) was sold to Cambridge Analytica unlawfully. This had a big impact on society considering the connections Cambridge Analytica had with Trump's election campaign 
									 and Russia. (<a href="https://www.ilpost.it/2018/03/19/facebook-cambridge-analytica/">Il Post</a>.). There are any other examples such as Uber's God View or Twitter's data acces to advertisers (<a href="https://www.invisibly.com/learn-blog/data-misuse-7-examples/">Source</a>). 
									what is common is often these cases are not due to leaks or hacks, instead they are wrong privacy policies by the media companies and the desire to make profit on user's privacy (see the famous interview of Zuckerberg in front of USA senate).
									My opinion is that prior to recent years there was not the realization of the power this data had and therefore the regulations were not adeguate. Laws have done steps forward in this matter in recent times with GDPR rules and USA and UK equivalents. 
									This also makes me think about modern technology revolutions such as AI and AGI, is there a sufficient regulation for these technologies? Do we realize the potential and the need to limit or guide in the right direction these technologies? I think that we don't yet.
									Many AI researchers and relevant researchers in the field sustain that a regulamentation in this field is necessary, we may be already late, as we were late for the big data revolution.
								</p>
								<h1 style="color: white;">Unit 6</h1>
								<p>
									The formative activity of this week is to review a questionnaire. I recently completed a questionnaire for a friend for her university in communication research about cinema. I'll give my opinions without revealing the full questionnaire or the name, I'll try to cite part of the questions.
									First of all there was not a well done identification of the target. Few questions about the subject (only age), although there are some topics that are delicate, such as gender, an answer like "I prefer not to respond" can be an effective way to not make anyone feel discomfort and include the question anyway.
									The number of questions was appropriate, 15 Qs. Some of the questions were too general, ie "How much do you like spending time watching films?", doesn't give much informations, a question like "How high/low would you rank watching films in your hobbies?" would have been a more quantifiable and direct question. Number of answers was odd, an odd number of answers makes the subject tend to respond in impartial 
									ways, therfore choosing the middle answer, it is better to try to force the subject to take a stand putting even number of answers, especially when asking for opinions. Wording of the questions was concise and clear but no image was included which can be a flaw in involving participants. 
									The questionnaire provided an acceptance of data managemnt form but no reassurance on the use of data, although it stated that was not for commercial purpose.
									Overall was a good questionnaire with some room for improvement.
								</p>
								<p>
									Youtube's surveys: I find interesting and wanted to mention the inclusion of surveys instead of ads in youtube's videos, I think they are a good move since they are quicker than ads, short and easy to do. They show instead of ads which is good, they would be percieved as 
									annoying if added on top of ads. They are quick and non-invasive (although google already has information on your profile).
								</p>
								<h1 style="color: white;">Unit 7</h1>
								<p>
									Unit 7 was a big week, there was the first assignment deadline about the literature review, i will talk about assignments more in the reflective piece so I won't spend too much time on it now. I'll say that at first I thought it to be a boring assignment but the longer I did it the longer I realized how much I liked it and how useful it was.
									This week was also the start of the second collaborative discussion and I posted the initial post that, as id did for the previous one, I'll leave here:

								</p>
								<p style="border:1px solid white; padding: 10px;">
									Abi's case study raises several ethical concerns related to the accuracy of information in research. As a researcher and statistical programmer, Abi has an ethical responsibility to present accurate data and results to the manufacturer. Changing data values or suggesting analyzing data in a way that supports multiple conclusions would be considered unethical behaviour. In this case, Abi should present positive and negative analyses to the manufacturer and not be biased towards any particular conclusion.

 

It is important to note that Abi is also responsible for the use of his program results by others. Therefore, it is his responsibility to ensure that the results are accurate and reliable (Nakazawa et al., 2018). Abi could face legal implications if he provides false or misleading information, which could harm consumers who may consume Whizzz (National Institutes of Health, 2018). Socially, Abi may face a backlash from the public if it is discovered that he knowingly provided false information. Professionally, his reputation may be damaged, and he may face disciplinary action from his institution or professional association (Resnik, 2017).

 

If the manufacturer chooses to publicize only the positive results, Abi could also decide to make his negative results publicly available, either through publication in academic journals or by making the data available through open-access platforms.

 

In conclusion, it is crucial that researchers uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct to ensure that the results of their research are reliable and trustworthy (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017).

									Interesting discussion about ethics, a matter that is often underestimated in IT field, thinking that virtual applications can't hurt, but it's exactly the opposite as described by some of the cases.
								</p>
								<h1 style="color: white;">Unit 8</h1>
								<p>
									Week 8 was really interesting, the main focus point was statistical analysis in Excel. There were examples and explenations, then as formative activity we had to complete the analysis as learned, using Excel. I particularly enjoyed
									this activities as I found them really useful. I'll include the unit 8 worksheets <a href="https://github.com/andreagussoniCS/research-methods-module">here.</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									On the other hand there was again the opportunity to submit early stage research proposal. I failed to submit it unfortunately. It was a great occasion and I did not take advantage of it. The module is, as preannounced, fast paced and packed with information and it is in fact hard to stay up to speed. While the module is on track to become one of the most difficult, it is also a candidate to be one of the most interesting.
									This said it was my fault and probably the mark will suffer from it.
								</p>
								<p>
									As we have done before, in Unit 8 we continued with the collaborative discussion, I will leave my responses here to <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=147051#p216792">Emmanuel's post</a> and <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=145879#p216830">Kate's post</a>. 
									As for the response on my post you can find them <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=145951#p213483">here.</a> I'll write a general impression with the summary post.
								</p>
								<h1 style="color: white;">Unit 9</h1>
								<p>
									This unit is about business statistics and how to visualize and interpret data. In my opinion this is a needed aspect in the course of studies and it is really important. The formative activity from this week is the second part of the excel exercises.
									I have uploaded them
