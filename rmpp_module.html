                                <h1 style="color: white;">Unit 1</h1>
                                <p>The first unit of the module opens up with a reasoning quiz focused on understanding the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning. Topics like this seem obvious and you usually don't think much about them but they are
                                    more important that may seem, reflecting on the obvious things is almost always an extraordinary excercise to develop critical thinking.
                                    The week progresses with a discussion about some case studies invented by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/case-studies">ACM</a>. The goal here is to reflect and contribute about how important are ethics in the world of Computer science.
                                    I'll leave here my first post for reference and express my thoughts after.
                                    <img src="images/initial_post.png" alt="">
                                    <br>
                                    The cases were pretty interesting but i chose this one because it was perfect to highlight how much of an impact can computer science have. Often we underestimate the damage we can do, thinking that it's just a software and it can't physically harm anyone.
                                    This example evidences the opposite. It is also important to mention that harm is not only physical but a incredible amount of damage can be done without injuring anyone.
                                    <br>
                                    There is a reflective excercise in this unit on the work of <strong>Stahl et al (2016) and Bott (2018) Chapter 1</strong>. The documents were about ethics and laws. My opinion is that while laws are obviously a fundamental part
                                    of any work that any professional should know about, ethics are more personal and subject to variations. CS professional are certainly required to follow their relevant organizations' laws. When it comes to non-regulated ethics it is more complicated.
                                    It is useful to refer to some of the ethics codes that are available and they are an invaluable source for reflection. There can be cases, however, where an individual needs to make difficult decisions that aren't covered in those codes or are too complex to be 
                                    categorized. It is up to the moral rectitude of the person to decide what's right and what's not. I personally believe that the people wotking in such a modern field that requires an open and agile mind are able to make the right decision in scenarios of uncertainty.
