                                <p>The first unit of the module opens up with a reasoning quiz focused on understanding the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning. Topics like this seem obvious and you usually don't think much about them but they are
                                    more important that may seem, reflecting on the obvious things is almost always an extraordinary excercise to develop critical thinking.
                                    The week progresses with a discussion about some case studies invented by the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/case-studies">ACM</a>. The goal here is to reflect and contribute about how important are ethics in the world of Computer science.
                                    I'll leave here my first post for reference and express my thoughts after.</p>

The case study from ACM describes a situation at Q Industries, an international defence contractor specializing in autonomous vehicles. The company has been experimenting with automated active responses, including facial recognition and non-lethal incapacitation measures, but has been approached by multiple governments to expand to lethal responses (ACM, 2017).

Multiple Q industries engineers resigned after the company's leadership accepted the government's proposals, fearing and not supporting the effects of these assignments, which violated points 1.2 and 2.7 of the ACM ethics code, on ethical conduct. The BCS Code of Conduct (British Computer Society, 2018) also prioritizes public good and ethical behaviour, encouraging computing professionals to consider the potential impact of their work on society.

The situation raises multiple concerns about the violation of the privacy of people involved, the right of protestors (V. Aston, 2017) to manifest and the problematic topic of giving lethal weapons to automated systems, a computer can never be held accountable (IBM, 1970).

                                    The cases were pretty interesting but i chose this one because it was perfect to highlight how much of an impact can computer science have. Often we underestimate the damage we can do, thinking that it's just a software and it can't physically harm anyone.
                                    This example evidences the opposite. It is also important to mention that harm is not only physical but a incredible amount of damage can be done without injuring anyone.
                                    <br>
                                    There is a reflective excercise in this unit on the work of <strong>Stahl et al (2016) and Bott (2018) Chapter 1</strong>. The documents were about ethics and laws. My opinion is that while laws are obviously a fundamental part
                                    of any work that any professional should know about, ethics are more personal and subject to variations. CS professional are certainly required to follow their relevant organizations' laws. When it comes to non-regulated ethics it is more complicated.
                                    It is useful to refer to some of the ethics codes that are available and they are an invaluable source for reflection. There can be cases, however, where an individual needs to make difficult decisions that aren't covered in those codes or are too complex to be 
                                    categorized. It is up to the moral rectitude of the person to decide what's right and what's not. I personally believe that the people wotking in such a modern field that requires an open and agile mind are able to make the right decision in scenarios of uncertainty. 
									<br>
									Lastly there was a quiz about inductive vs deductive reasoning. We can think of deductive reasoning just like a pyramid where the tip and starting point then you go through the middle which is the hypothesis and the base is the theory extracted. For the inductive reasoning
									you invert the pyramid so now you start with a theory, you continue through observation and hypothesis to arrive at a conclusion.

									In unit 2 we started choosing the topic for the literature review from a fairly complete list of arguments. I immediately found the sentiment analysis topic fascinating. My plan was to use the sentiment analysis topic for the literature review and then, maybe with a twist, for the research proposal. 
									I sent an eamil to the tutor to ask what could be better to do and it was very helpful.
									Apart from this the main formative activity of unit 2 was to answer to my colleagues' posts in the discussion started in Unit 1. I'll leave the <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=135767#p190476">LINK</a> to my post with all the responses
									since it would be verbose to include it here. And here are my responses to <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=135690#p192237">Kate's</a> post and <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=135597#p194225">Jonathan's</a> post.

								<h1 style="color:white">Unit 3</h1>
								<p>
									This week was about the different type of research methods. In particular the e-portfolio activity was to think about the most suitable approach for my chosen topic. While the literature review is a qualitative and critic focused research independently of the topic, as suggested by our tutor, 
									The research proposal is different. Since my topic is about machine learning and sentiment analysis the correct approach for this topic would be quantitative and experimental. As read in many researches in the field, the greatest part of this type of research is testing the models created
									and gather data to compare performances. Therefore the main data collecting method would be experiments and observations.

									This week was also the conclusion of the collaborative discussion where we had to make a summary post about our initial post and subsequent responses, here is my post:

First of all, thanks for the responses to my post.

As a conclusion to this thread, I'm using as a starting point Kate's response. Are the remaining engineers in wrong for respecting the confidentiality agreement and not risking their careers and maybe their economic/social stability? This is one of the most complex topics, ethics. The term has been defined in different ways throughout history. Ethics matter is subjective both in its definition and interpretation. It is not a measurable metric and what is ethical to one could not be to another. This is why codes of conduct exist and they try to give an interpretation of what is better for the majority of a community, the computing community in this case (ACM, BCS 2017, 2018).

Ethics in modern society can be viewed as a collection of standards and moral values that humans usually agree on, for example, the repudiation of murder, stealing or fraud (Velazquez et al, 2010).

According to this the engineers that resigned and denounced the case are in this case considered ethical, but again, this would be my interpretation.
