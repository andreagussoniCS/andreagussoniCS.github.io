                                <h1 style="color: white;">Unit 1</h1>
                                <p>Unit 1 starts with a discussion forum about security threats. The suggestion is to use 
                                    a list of security flaws provided by OWASP a non profit organization helping the web
                                    to mantain a standard of security. Really interesting things coming out of this discussion with the 
                                    focus being on designing a UML model to represent the vulnerabnility chosen. I'll leave here below the first iteration of the model
                                    that got better with the suggestions of the tutor and my colleague Marianne stimulating me to dive into the topic.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    First model:
                                    <br>

                                    Second model:
                                    <br>
                                    <br>

								<p>
									The discussion about Injection flaws can now be summarized, thanks to the stimulating responses from my colleagues, the topic has gone in 
									more depth than I could have done alone. Here's the post:

									<h3>
									Buffer overflow
									</h3>
									A comparison between C language and Python language, contrary to what you may think, also type safe languages like python may suffer from memory manipulation, for instance in Python there is a 
									function vulnerable to memory attacks that has been out since python 2 and still is vulnerable in python 3, these Codio excersise gave the opportunity for a team discussion about Python vs C.
									What came out is that no programming language is totally secure and from that point of view the two are similar, they differentiate in many other ascpects. Python being a high level language, suited for 
									many general purposes is portable and can enjoy a vast amount of libraries and an active community that made it a great language for machine learning, AI and many more. C is a low level language, less clear than Python but
									with much faster compiling times and particularly suited for operative systems, in fact many of the most popular operative systems rely for big parts of them on C language.

									Two important programming concepts we can extract from this week.
									<h3>
									Hanoi tower and recursion
									</h3>
									Recursion is a powerful tool in programming languages that enables programmers to solve complex problems, but we should really be careful of the space and time complexity that can be introduced by this technique.
									Hanoi tower, of which you can find an example down here (credits to Khan academy), is a classic example of the utility of recursion, with a complexity of O2^n - 1, considering a computer making 1000 moves per second even
									a small number of disks like 36 could take 2 years to solve and with the number going up to the famous 64 disks it takes 59 x 10^7 years to complete.
									<br>

									<br>
									Regular expressions are a big aspect of programming, giving the ability to parse strings and select the desired contents they have the capability to avoid security issues such as
									SQL injection, search patterns in text and validate user inputs. The possibilities with regex compositions can vary from simple to extremely complex in an arbitrary manner. Here below there is a practical cheat sheet taken
									from Wikipedia that explains how characters are used in order to customize the desires search pattern.

                                <h1 style="color: white;">Unit 5</h1>
								<p>
									Starting with the incredibly discussed topic of testing, this unit's focus, the benefits and the essentiality of testing, especially in the secure software development section, are not in any doubt.
									A discussion can be made about how and when it is better to test and for how long. Depending on the individual cases there are plenty of resources that guide developers to the best practices used by the community.
									To cite the biggest non-profit organization that guides internationally developers towards security (OWASP) here is the <a href="https://owasp.org/">LINK</a>. 
									<br>
									A particular attention is given to Cyclomatic complexity during this week, here I'll share some insights of discussion between team members and class. It is a commonly used metric to measure software complexity, that is often doubted due to its incompleteness to evaluate certain aspects of software 
									such as in measuring data complexity that has become a major part of software in modern times. It is although useful for certain purposes like quality metric and to give an idea
									of the part of a software where is necessary to focus the testing efforts. I like to share a quick represantation of Cyclomatic complexity formula (credit to Geeks fro Geeks):

                                <h1 style="color: white;">Unit 6</h1>
								<p>
									Design document submission week, the initial work for the developing of a secure software for the Ducth police department started with a design plan for the software itself, including 
									security decisions, tools and UML diagrams. I'll share here the activity diagram I generated for the project to give an idea of the design:
									<br>
									<img src="images/activity diag.png" alt="">
									<br>
									Also through the codio excersises we explored some powerful tools for code readability. Following the industry standards when it comes to code writing is a hugely important matter, PEP8 defines the standards for python, and it is the base for most 
									styling libraries such as stylint (library to enforce Python conventions). Experimenting with the code resulted in the evidence of a certain difference between flake8 and pylint, often regarded as fairly similar. Pylint is stricter when managing conventions errors (such as naming conventions) than flake8, while flake8 is easier to use and has many useful plugins.

                                <h1 style="color: white;">Unit 7</h1>
								<h3>SOA ontology</h3>
								<p>
									An ontology is something that refers to the purpose, aim and nature of something. It describes the conceptual implications of an object. When referred to SOA, which is a paradigm for service oriented architectures,
									it describes the standard for the creation of a SOA architecture based on classes and properties but also relations. From what I have understood and connected to the current module project an ontology can be used to clearly define entities in a certain domain.
									It seems to me to be pretty in line with OOP and so it can be really useful for the architectural definition of an application such as the one we are developing, from user role definition to the definition of the range of services the app can offer. Giving a way to share a reuse this knowledge in different scenarios (Munir and Anjum, 2018).
								</p>
								<h3>Flask and APIs</h3>
								<p>
									<img src="images/flask api test.png" alt="">
									<br>

									Flask is a common Python way to build APIs and web server that, through URLs, can communicate with a DB or server following REST APIs standards. In the screenshot I ran the python script with usual "python" command, then when we hit a URL that includes an existing user it returns informations for that user, instead when the user is not
									present we'll see an error message on the screen. I think of it like the pythonic way of using express and NodeJS for JavaScript.
